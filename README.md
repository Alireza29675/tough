## Motivation

Web Scraping is what you love and most website owners not. Best websites defence against being scraped is to change HTML structure once a month, a week or even a day.
Adjusting your code is the biggest problem and here's **Tough**, an element selector which uses human-like strategies to find a data inside a web document.
